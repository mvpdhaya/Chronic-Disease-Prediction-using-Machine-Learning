# Chronic Disease Prediction using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to predict chronic diseases using various machine learning algorithms. The system takes user-provided health data as input and predicts the likelihood of diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, or hypertension using trained models.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Predicts multiple chronic diseases based on input health parameters  
- Implements machine learning models like Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Provides evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Uses a well-structured dataset with relevant health indicators  
- Python-based implementation with machine learning libraries  

## 📊 Dataset  
- The dataset contains medical records with various features like age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, etc.  
- Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection  
- If using a public dataset, provide the source link
